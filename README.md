# Welcome to Legacized!
Welcome to the revolutionary modpack that brings back LCE(Legacy Console Edition), for Java Edition! We use the best mods (primarily Legacy4j) to not only recreate the classic experience, but also bring more content that fits the nostaligc feel and make everything cleaner!

### You can download here!: https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacized

### Features included:
- Classic menu, crafting, interface, and everything you can imagine related to the screen!
- Online support! Using the mod "e4mc" (or "World Host" for 1.21.5), you can join your friends in your worlds!
- Minigames have been brought back! Using the mod Minimega, you can now play classic games, such as Glide, and fanmade games, such as Fistfight! (Spleef and Battle are not added into Minimega yet). You will need a Discord account to join their Discord server to start playing Online. You can play Offline without it, however. For more information about the mod, check the Modrinth page: https://modrinth.com/mod/minimega
- Texture Packs, World Templates, and Skin Packs from your old Mash-Ups! You can now use most Texture Packs and Skin Packs lost to the consoles, with custom ones added too! Select your style, from celebrating the holidays with the Festive Mash-Up, or dressing up as Jeb himself with the Skin Packs! (Most World Templates are still missing, but are being added eventually!)
- Lots of small but fun tweeks, such as Golden Apple recipes, a classic World Generation option, foggy world borders, and much much more!
- Controller support, provided by Legacy4j. Connect various controllers, such as Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and others! The "Edition" on the title screen changes to your controller style too!
- Legacy4j is the main power behing all of this. Without this mod, this modpack wouldn't be here today. Please check out Legacy4j on their Modrinth!: https://modrinth.com/mod/legacy4j
